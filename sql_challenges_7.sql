In the exercises below you will need to use the following clauses:
    - GROUP BY
    - HAVING

/*******************************************************************************
GROUP BY

*******************************************************************************/

-- 1. Find the total amount of authors for each state

SELECT state, COUNT(*) AS total_authors FROM authors GROUP BY state;

/* 2. Find the total amount of authors by each state and order them in 
    descending order */

SELECT state, COUNT(*) AS total_authors FROM authors GROUP BY state ORDER BY total_authors DESC;

-- 3. What's the price of the most expensive title from each publisher?

SELECT pub_id, MAX(price) AS most_expensive_title FROM titles GROUP BY pub_id;

-- 4. Find out the top 3 stores with the most sales

SELECT stor_id, SUM(qty) AS total_sales FROM sales GROUP BY stor_id ORDER BY total_sales DESC LIMIT 3;

/* 5. Find the average job level for each job_id from the employees table.
    Order the jobs in ascending order by its average job level. */

SELECT job_id, AVG(job_lvl) AS avg_job_level FROM employee GROUP BY job_id ORDER BY avg_job_level ASC;

/* 6. For each type (business, psychology…), find out how many books each
    publisher has. */

SELECT pub_id, type, COUNT(*) AS book_count FROM titles GROUP BY pub_id, type;

/* 7. Add the average price of each publisher - book type combination from your
   previous query */

SELECT pub_id, type, COUNT(*) AS book_count, AVG(price) AS avg_price FROM titles GROUP BY pub_id, type;

/*******************************************************************************
HAVING

https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_having.asp
*******************************************************************************/

/* 8. From your previous query, keep only the combinations of publisher - book
   type with an average price higher than 12 */

SELECT pub_id, type, COUNT(*) AS book_count, AVG(price) AS avg_price FROM titles GROUP BY pub_id, type HAVING AVG(price) > 12;

/* 9. Order the results of your previous query by these two criteria:
      1. Count of books, descendingly
      2. Average price, descendingly */

SELECT pub_id, type, COUNT(*) AS book_count, AVG(price) AS avg_price FROM titles GROUP BY pub_id, type HAVING AVG(price) > 12 ORDER BY book_count DESC, avg_price DESC;

/* 10. Some authors have a contract, while others don't - it's indicated in the
     "contract" column of the authors table.
     
     Select all the states and cities where there are 2 or more contracts 
     overall */

SELECT state, city, COUNT(*) AS contract_count FROM authors WHERE contract = 1 GROUP BY state, city HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2;

/* 
The main difference between WHERE and HAVING is that:
    - the WHERE clause is used to specify a condition for filtering most records
    - the HAVING clause is used to specify a condition for filtering values from 
      an aggregate (such as MAX(), AVG(), COUNT() etc...)
